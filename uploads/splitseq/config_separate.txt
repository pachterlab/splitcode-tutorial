# splitcode config file for demultiplexing barcodes into wells
# A hamming distance error of 1 is permitted
# For R1:
## If there is a hamming distance collision (e.g. CATTCCTA vs. CATTCCAT), the read is considered unassigned
### (Putting $ after the barcode filenames AND giving each filename a different ID ensures that every single barcode gets a unique ID)
### (Each barcode having a unique ID allows the "hamming distance collision = unassigned" to happen since multiple IDs being mapped is not allowed)
### (Note: Barcodes are complex enough so that each barcode is at least two hamming distances away from other barcodes [i.e. cases like CATTCCTA vs. CATTCCTT won't happen]; but there are some collisions).
